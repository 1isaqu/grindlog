# grindlog
GrindLog is a local-first training tracker for serious lifters. No social, no feed, no dopamine loops.  Core: - Log workouts in &lt;15s - Exercise DB defined by the user - History, PR tracking, volume metrics - IndexedDB (Dexie) as source of truth - Optional cloud sync (FastAPI + Mongo)  Philosophy: You vs your past data. Not validation from others.
